## Python 2.7 Quick Reference

This is the [reference guide to Python](reference.py) that I wish had existed when I was learning the language.

Here's what I want in a reference guide:

- High-quality examples that show the simplest possible usage of a given feature
- Explanatory comments, and descriptive variable names that eliminate the need for some comments
- Presented as a single Python script, so that I can keep it open in my IDE and search it when needed
- Code that can be run from top to bottom, with the relevant objects defined nearby

This is not written as a full-fledged "learn Python" tutorial, though I ordered the topics such that you can read it like a tutorial, in that no topic depends on material below it.

Here are the currently available topics:

- Imports
- Data Types
- Math
- Comparisons and Boolean Operations
- Conditional Statements
- Lists
- Tuples
- Strings
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Defining Functions
- Anonymous (Lambda) Functions
- For Loops and While Loops
- Comprehensions
- Map, Reduce, Filter

If you like the general format of this guide, but need more explanation of each topic, I highly recommend reading the Appendix of [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do). It presents the essentials of the Python language in a clear and focused manner.

If you are looking for a resource that will help you to learn Python from scratch, this is [my list of recommended resources](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT8#python-resources).

If there's a topic or example you'd like me to add to this guide, or you notice a mistake, please [create a GitHub issue](issues) or [contact me directly](http://www.dataschool.io/about/).

Thank you!
